This is a set of examples that shows how to work with Asterisk using Asterisk-Java, astmanproxy, and Groovy

Running these examples requires having an instance of asterisk and astmanproxy running at ip 192.168.56.101 (feel free to change in AbstractAsteriskProxyConnectionFactory) at port 5039.

A user will be required with username = 'manager' and password = 'password'

A VirtualBox VirtualMachine worked fine for running Asterisk and astmanproxy for me.
